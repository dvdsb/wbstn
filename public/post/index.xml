      <description>IntroductionThis is the second of three posts that address:
1. Predicting the probability of a “positive” (reject \(H_{0}\)) study before running the study
2. Interim analyses during the study
3. Evaluating study data in a meaningful way after the study is completed.
The first post is available here.
Interim analyses of an ongoing clinical trial enable early stopping due to efficacy or futility. Clinical trials that involve interims data looks are often referred to as group sequential trials.</description>

The general linear modelConsider the general linear model with a single factor (One-way ANOVA) for a mean centered variable \(Y_{ij}\), \(Y_{ij}=Z_{ij}-\overline{Z}\):</description>

      <description>IntroductionIn this post I´ll explore some basic approaches to analyze a simple simulated data example.
Two sample continuous outcomeConsider a dependent variable Y and an independent variable X (two levels, A and B).Standardize Y to get zero mean and unit standard deviation.
DAT &amp;lt;- tibble(N = 60 , X = rbinom(N, 1, 0.5),Y = 0.5*X + rnorm(N)) %&amp;gt;% mutate(X = factor(X, labels = c(&amp;quot;A&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;)) , Y = (Y-mean(Y, na.</description>
